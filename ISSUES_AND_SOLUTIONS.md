# System Issues Analysis and Solutions

## Areas of Concern

1. System Monitoring
- `systemMonitor.js` and `advancedMetrics.js` show overlapping responsibilities
- Need to consolidate monitoring logic and improve threshold handling
- Missing proper error recovery mechanisms

2. Error Handling
- Basic error handler implementation needs enhancement
- No structured logging or categorization of errors
- Missing correlation between errors and system metrics

3. Security
- Authentication system needs strengthening
- Token validation could be improved
- Cleanup mechanism should be more robust

## Recommended Actions

1. System Monitoring
- Consolidate monitoring logic into a single service
- Implement proper event handling for threshold breaches
- Add recovery mechanisms for system overload

2. Error Handling
- Implement structured error logging
- Add error categorization
- Correlate errors with system metrics
- Implement proper error recovery strategies

3. Security
- Enhance token validation with additional checks
- Implement rate limiting on authentication
- Add security audit logging
- Improve cleanup mechanism efficiency

## Implementation Steps

1. System Monitoring Updates
```javascript
// Update SystemMonitor class to include:
- Enhanced metrics collection
- Proper event emission
- Threshold management
- Recovery procedures
```

2. Error Handling Improvements
```javascript
// Enhance ErrorHandler to include:
- Structured logging
- Error categories
- Correlation with metrics
- Recovery strategies
```

3. Security Enhancements
```javascript
// Enhance EnhancedAuth class with:
- Robust token validation
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging
- Efficient cleanup
```

## Testing Requirements

1. System Monitoring
- Test threshold detection
- Verify event emission
- Validate recovery procedures

2. Error Handling
- Test error categorization
- Verify logging structure
- Test recovery mechanisms

3. Security
- Test token validation
- Verify rate limiting
- Test cleanup procedures

## Implementation Priority

1. Error Handling (High Priority)
2. Security Enhancements (High Priority)
3. System Monitoring Consolidation (Medium Priority)
