# System Architecture Guide

## Overview

### Components
1. **Bot Core**: Handles Discord interactions and commands.
2. **Payment Services**: Manages payment processing, validation, and rewards.
3. **Load Balancer**: Distributes payment requests across providers.
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Provides real-time metrics and performance monitoring.
5. **Database**: Stores transaction records, user data, and configuration settings.

### Data Flow
1. User initiates a payment via Discord command.
2. Payment request is routed through the Load Balancer.
3. Selected Payment Provider processes the transaction.
4. Webhook updates are received and validated.
5. User rewards are processed and recorded.
6. Analytics Dashboard updates metrics in real-time.

## Deployment Architecture

### Infrastructure
- **Server**: Hosts the bot and related services.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for transaction and user data.
- **Cache**: Redis for caching and session management.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for performance metrics.

### Network
- **Ingress**: NGINX for load balancing and SSL termination.
- **Egress**: Secure connections to payment providers and Discord API.

## Security
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 for Discord, API keys for payment providers.
- **Encryption**: TLS for data in transit, AES-256 for data at rest.
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for admin commands.
- **Monitoring**: Real-time alerts for suspicious activity and errors.

## Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple instances of the bot for high availability.
- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on load.
- **Load Balancing**: Weighted routing and failover for payment providers.
